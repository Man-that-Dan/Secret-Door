Project description: Secret Door is a top down dungeon crawler. The objective is to escape
the labyrinth that you find yourself in. Problem is the door is locked. Your objective is
to search the labyrinth, figure out how to open the door, and escape. All while fending off the undead.

Solution to the puzzle :

in the top right, bottom left, and bottom right of the map there are interactable objects each
with an image of fire, water, or grass. The fire must point directly right (at the grass), the water must point diagonally
down to the left (at the fire) and the grass straight up. The door on the right wall of the map (in the center) will open
and walking into it will trigger the win screen. Interact with the puzzles with T then use A and D to move them. 


The Pizzazz feature that I added:
 I am particularly proud of the 3d columns. I made them in a class without opengl and they add depth to the
 game. There is also a basic puzzle to be solved as the objective of the game. There are also lights which give the game
 a haunting ambience.
