in the top right, bottom left, and bottom right of the map there are interactable objects each
with an image of fire, water, or grass. The fire must point directly right (at the grass), the water must point diagonally
down to the left (at the fire) and the grass straight up. The door on the right wall of the map (in the center) will open
and walking into it will trigger the win screen. Interact with the puzzles with T then use A and D to move them.
